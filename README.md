# Programming Language Suggester

#### By Noah Kise

#### A simple form to fill out that gathers user inputs and uses them to return a suggestion for the best programming language to study first. It is lighthearted, and not meant to be taken seriously.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VS Code
* Git

## Description

This is a webpage containing a form to fill out to generate a programming language. Buzzfeed quizzes were my inspiration. It was completed for the second code review assignment at Epicodus. The user chooses a color, builds their ideal 3 topping pizza (with or without ranch), chooses a picture, and tells a joke.  The webpage gathers these inputs and returns a programming language suggestion based on them. These are not meant to be real suggestions.
